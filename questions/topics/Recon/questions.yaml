      What kind of preoperative diagnosis increases the risk of sciatic nerve injury in primary total hip arthroplasty (<say-as interpret-as="characters">THA</say-as>)?
    </speak>

  MultipleChoice:
    Correct: Developmental dysplasia of the hip
    Incorrect:
      - Male gender
      - Anterolateral approach
      - Posterior superior quadrant acetabular screw placement
      - Osteonecrosis

  CorrectAnswers:
    - DDH
  IncorrectAnswers:
    - Scoliosis

  Keywords: []
  KeywordsOnly: false

  Explanation: >
    Injury to the sciatic nerve is a relatively rare but serious complication of THA. Dissection of the sciatic nerve is not typically done during primary THA, although the nerve can be identified during the surgical approach. An anterolateral approach to THA would not necessarily be associated with any greater incidence of sciatic nerve injury than other approaches. Screw fixation for the acetabular component is often a matter of surgeon preference. Provided that the anatomic safe zones for screw fixation (posterior inferior and posterior superior) are recognized, injury to the sciatic nerve from acetabular screws can be minimized. Restoration of anatomic length is important in primary THA. Overlengthening can result in sciatic nerve palsy. Developmental dysplasia of the hip can lead to a congenitally shortened extremity with concomitant congenital shortening of the associated neurovascular structures. Overlengthening of the extremity during THA for developmental dysplasia of the hip can lead to sciatic palsy. Osteonecrosis is not an associated risk factor for sciatic nerve palsy.

    While obtaining informed consent for a lateral closing-wedge tibial osteotomy, what complication should be discussed with the patient as exclusive to this procedure and not encountered in medial opening-wedge tibial osteotomy?

  MultipleChoice:
    Correct: Proximal tibiofibular joint disruption
    Incorrect:
      - Compartment syndrome
      - Plate breakage
      - Neurologic injury

  Explanation: >
    With lateral closing-wedge osteotomy, proximal tibiofibular disruption can occur. This is not seen in medial opening-wedge osteotomy. A technique has been developed to prevent this complication; a fibular osteotomy is performed at the same time as the tibial osteotomy. The other complications listed are seen in both techniques, with nonunion and plate breakage more common in opening-wedge high tibial osteotomy (HTO) and neurologic injury more common in closing-wedge HTO (with issues related to the common peroneal nerve most prevalent). Compartment syndrome is a devastating complication that can occur with any osteotomy, and a high index of suspicion should be maintained during the postsurgical course for patients who develop this condition.

  Question: >
    What is the primary mechanism of polyethylene wear in the hip?

  MultipleChoice:
    Correct: Adhesion and abrasion
    Incorrect:
      - Fatigue cracking and delamination
      - Oscillatory fretting
      - Crevice corrosion
      - Oxidative degradation

  Explanation: >
    Although previous theories on acetabular wear implicated fatigue cracking and delamination as primary wear mechanisms, these have actually manifested as major modes of polyethylene wear in knees. The primary mechanism of wear in polyethylene acetabular components appears to be adhesion and abrasion. In an analysis of 128 components retrieved at autopsy or revision surgery, wear appeared to occur mostly at the surface of the components and was the result of large strain plastic deformation and orientation of the surface layers into fibrils that subsequently ruptured during multidirectional motion. It was also shown conclusively that 32-mm heads displayed significantly more wear (volumetric wear) than either 22-mm or 26-/28-mm heads (1-mm increase in size increased volumetric wear by 10%). The wear at the articulating surface was characterized by highly worn polished areas superiorly and less worn areas inferiorly separated by a ridge. Abrasion was very common, occurring after adhesion and plastic deformation of polyethylene fibrils, and abrasion secondary to third-body wear. Wear rates decreased with longer survival of components, indicating a “bedding in” phenomenon, arguing against oxidative and fatigue wear. Crevice corrosion occurs in fatigue cracks with low oxygen tension (under screw heads, etc). Oscillatory fretting consists of cyclical abrading of the outer surface from small movements. Fatigue and delamination is predominant in total knee arthroplasty where stresses are maximum just below the surface of the polyethylene component, causing fatigue over time with subsequent delamination. In contrast, hip wear occurs primarily at the surface of the polyethylene component.

  Question: >
    What is the most probable cause of the osteolysis?
    The radiographs of a cemented total knee arthroplasty show substantial amounts of osteolysis underneath the tibial baseplate. There is no evidence of excessive wear of the superior surface of the polyethylene. The patient has had no previous implants, and the prosthesis has no intramedullary stem. 
    What is the most probable cause of the osteolysis?

  MultipleChoice:
    Correct: Polyethylene fretting wear debris from the backside of the insert
    Incorrect:
      - Stress shielding caused by the implant, leading to bone resorption
      - Polyethylene wear debris from the tibiofemoral surface articulation
      - Metal wear debris from the tibiofemoral surface articulation
      - Cement debris from the cement-bone fixation surfaces

  Explanation: >
    A number of studies have shown that in some designs of total knee implants, micromotion and fretting between the backside of the polyethylene insert and the tibial tray can generate significant amounts of wear debris, sufficient to cause substantial osteolysis. Stress shielding is not a likely cause in this case because there is no intramedullary stem. In general, articulation of metal against polyethylene generates insignificant amounts of metal wear debris.

    Particulate wear debris is central to the mechanisms responsible for aseptic loosening.  The severity of the biologic response to particulate polyethylene wear debris is directly proportional to particle:

  MultipleChoice:
    Correct: number
    Incorrect:
      - size
      - composition
      - molecular weight

  Explanation: >
    The biologic response to polyethylene is highly dependent on the type and quantity of particles. The response is clearly dose-dependent. Multiple cytokines are involved in the biologic response to wear particles, and tumor necrosis factor alpha seems to be among the most important. Its secretion increases during the biologic response to particulate wear debris. Research has shown that particles sized between 0.2 µm and 7-8 µm are the most stimulatory, but a direct proportional correlation does not exist with sizes outside of this range. A lack of correlation also applies to molecular weight and composition of polyethylene debris.

  Keywords: [[anteversion]]
  KeywordsOnly: false

  Explanation: >
    Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) leads to early arthritis of the hip as seen in this patient. Although DDH is believed to mostly affect the acetabulum, most patients with DDH also have anatomic aberrations of the femur. Using three-dimensional computer models generated by reconstruction of CT scans, dysplastic femurs were shown to have shorter necks and smaller, straighter canals than the controls. The shape of the canal became more abnormal with increasing subluxation. The studies also have shown that the primary deformity of the dysplastic femur is rotational, with an increase in anteversion of 5 degrees to 16 degrees, depending on the degree of subluxation of the hip. The rotational deformity of the dysplastic femur arises within the diaphysis between the lesser trochanter and the isthmus and is not attributable to a torsional deformity of the metaphysis. Osteopenia is not a concern in a patient with an excellent cortical index (thick cortices and narrow canal). Femoral varus or bowing of the femur is not a typical finding in patients with DDH.

  MultipleChoice:
    Correct: Thermal stabilization through remelting
    Incorrect:
      - Thermal stabilization through annealing
      - Stabilizing the polyethylene with vitamin C

  CorrectAnswers:

  IncorrectAnswers: []

  Keywords: [[remelt, remelting]]
  KeywordsOnly: false

  Explanation: >
    Free radicals, which are generated when polyethylene is exposed to ionizing radiation, are highly reactive and can be quenched by cross-linking with each other or via oxidation in the presence of oxygen. Thermal stabilization techniques are designed to minimize the number of remaining free radicals available to react with oxygen. Remelting is the most efficient method to reduce free radicals. Annealing also greatly reduces the number of free radicals, but cannot quench as many free radicals as remelting. Vitamin E has been shown to protect against oxidation by quenching free radicals; however, vitamin C has not shown the same benefit. Gamma irradiation with 10 Mrads will generate many free radicals regardless of the presence or absence of oxygen.

      - Remelting
      - Annealing

  CorrectAnswers:
    - gamma irradiation
  IncorrectAnswers: []

  Keywords: []
  KeywordsOnly: false

  Explanation: >
    UHMWPE is a long polyethylene polymer with a high molecular weight. It is manufactured via ram bar extrusion and compression molding. Radiation is used to sterilize and cross-link. Historically, gamma was irradiated in air at 2.5-4.0 Mrad. This created free radicals, resulting in early oxidative degradation with high wear rates, delamination, and fracture. Modern UHMWPE is highly cross-linked with higher doses of radiation (5.0-10 Mrad) in an inert environment. The level of radiation directly increases the amount of cross-linking and also improves wear resistance via cross-linking. Free radicals are still generated during the radiation process and are quenched by either remelting or annealing. Remelting is the heating of the polyethylene above its melt point, changing it from the partial crystalline state to the amorphous state and removing all free radicals, but also reducing wear characteristics. In annealing, the UHMWPE is heated below the melting point, which avoids the reduction in crystallinity but leaves more free radicals. Ethylene oxide is used in the sterilization process. Highly cross-linked polyethylene has shown significantly decreased wear rates compared to conventional polyethylene in both clinical and simulator studies. There is still some concern regarding decreased mechanical properties.

    How are free radicals removed from highly cross-linked polyethylene?

  MultipleChoice:
    Correct: Thermal processing
    Incorrect:
      - Oxidation
      - High-dose irradiation
      - Low-dose irradiation

  Explanation: >
    Cross-linking of polyethylene improves its wear property via a series of steps including irradiation, thermal processing, and sterilization.  Irradiation breaks carbon-hydrogen bonds in polyethylene and creates covalent bonds during cross-linking.  Both low- and high-dose irradiation create free radicals that can interact with oxygen to weaken the polyethylene.  Oxidation is the process through which oxygen is introduced into the polyethylene and possibly generates free radicals.  Thermal processing of irradiated polyethylene removes these free radicals.  Thermal processing is the heat treatment of cross-linked polyethylene to remove free radicals.  Annealing and remelting are 2 thermal processing types, with annealing being the preferred technique because it results in better mechanical properties of polyethylene.  Another strategy that can remove free radicals is to add an antioxidant such as vitamin E.  Sterilization is the final step before the packaging of polyethylene implants.

      - The process increases the ductility of the material
      - The process leads to fewer particles that are larger in size than the untreated material
      - The process decreases the wear rate of the material, compared to untreated polyethylene, when tested against a rough counterface

  IncorrectAnswers:
    - cross-linking
    - removal of radicals

  Keywords: []
  KeywordsOnly: false

  Explanation: >
    Exposure of polyethylene to radiation and then heating it to quench the free radicals leads to a cross-linked material. It converts a high molecular weight polyethylene macromolecule to an interpenetrating network structure of polymer chains. The ductility of the material is decreased, hence the greater risk of fracture. While the wear rate (measured as fewer and smaller particles) against a smooth counterface is markedly reduced, cross-linked polyethylene has shown a larger increase in wear rate when a rougher counterface is used compared to noncross-linked material. Due to reduced mechanical strength, highly cross-linked polyethylene is less resistant to abrasive wear.

    This patient has an acute postoperative deep infection, with prolonged drainage at 12 days postoperatively.  Even without other signs or symptoms of infection, the prolonged drainage this far out after surgery is concerning for an acute postoperative infection.  The most appropriate treatment at this point is open debridement with retention of the implants.  Modular parts, if present, are exchanged.  Oral or IV antibiotics alone are generally inadequate to treat the infection, and this form of management alone would result in a missed opportunity to potentially cure the infection.  Removal of all implants at this point is not required because early aggressive debridement within the first 2 weeks after surgery offers a reasonable outcome.  After 4 to 6 weeks of symptoms, results of debridement are less favorable and removal of the implants is usually required.

      - Obtain cultures and proceed with revision of the acetabulum only
      - Obtain cultures and proceed with revision of the femur only
      - Obtain cultures and close

  Explanation: >
    Despite the negative aspiration preoperatively, intraoperative findings are suspicious for infection. Additionally, the preoperative blood work is also concerning for infection with an elevated CRP and ESR. The frozen section is also positive. Most important is the unreliability of the Gram stain. Numerous investigators have show high false negative rates for Gram stain in chronic periprosthetic infection. The Gram stain should not be relied on for decision-making in revision surgery, particularly when other investigations point to infection. With the information available, the diagnosis is deep infection. The best course of action is to obtain cultures, remove the implants, and insert an antibiotic spacer. Only obtaining cultures and closing would require a second operation to remove the implants if the cultures are positive.

  Explanation: >
    Lateral subluxation of the patella following total knee arthroplasty has several possible causes, including internal rotation of the femoral component, internal rotation of the tibial component, and increasing the patellofemoral space (either increasing the composite thickness of the patella or anterior translation of the femoral component). Increasing the patellofemoral space leads to increased tension on the lateral patellofemoral retinaculum when a medial parapatellar approach is used. Increased tension in the lateral soft-tissue tether can cause lateral subluxation. Placement of the femoral and tibial components to the most lateral aspect of the cut surfaces helps to ensure the tibial tubercle is medialized appropriately to avoid lateral subluxation of the patellar component.

  MultipleChoice:
    Correct: Patella baja
    Incorrect:
      - Fracture
      - Patella alta
      - Osteonecrosis
      - Maltracking

  CorrectAnswers:
    - patella infera
    - low lying patella
    - patella position abnormally low
    - patella too low
  IncorrectAnswers:
    - patellar instability
    - patella high riding
    - patella position abnormally high
    - patella too high
    - patella maltracking

  Explanation: >
    Patella baja is commonly encountered when converting a high tibial osteotomy (HTO) to a TKA.  Patella baja most likely occurs because of scarring.  Meding and associates’ study did not show an increased rate of lateral release when converting a knee that had undergone a previous HTO.

    For the most predictable outcome, what implant should be used?
    A patient is scheduled to undergo total knee arthroplasty (TKA) following failure of nonsurgical management. History reveals that she underwent a patellectomy as a teenager as the result of a motor vehicle accident. Examination reveals normal ligamentous stability. 
    For the most predictable outcome, what implant should be used?

  MultipleChoice:
    Correct: Posterior cruciate ligament-substituting knee
    Incorrect:
      - Mobile-bearing knee
      - Posterior cruciate ligament-sparing knee
      - Semiconstrained-style knee
      - Triaxial hinged knee

  CorrectAnswers:
    - PS knee
    - posterior stabilized knee
  IncorrectAnswers:
    - anterior stabilized

  Explanation: >
    Paletta and Laskins performed a retrospective study of the results of TKA with cement in 22 patients who had a previous patellectomy. Nine of the patients had insertion of a posterior cruciate ligament-substituting implant. Thirteen patients had insertion of a posterior cruciate ligament-sparing implant. The 5-year postoperative knee scores were 89 for the posterior cruciate ligament-substituting knee versus 67 for the posterior cruciate ligament-sparing knee (P < 0.01). The patella functions to increase the lever arm of the extensor mechanism and to position the quadriceps tendon and the patellar ligament roughly parallel to the anterior cruciate ligament and posterior cruciate ligament, respectively. The patellar ligament thereby provides a strong reinforcing structure that functions to prevent excessive anterior translation of the femur during flexion of the knee. The absence of the patella results in the patellar ligament and the quadriceps tendon being relatively in line with one another. After a patellectomy, the resultant quadriceps force is no longer parallel to the posterior cruciate ligament. This results in loss of the reinforcing function of the patellar ligament. The authors believe this loss of reinforcing function may place increased stresses on the posterior cruciate ligament and posterior aspect of the capsule, which may result in stretching of these structures over time. They found a high rate of anteroposterior instability, a high prevalence of recurvatum, and a high rate of loss of full active extension compared with passive extension in the posterior cruciate ligament-sparing group, which supports their theory.

    A patient with a documented allergy to nickel requires a total knee arthroplasty.  What prosthesis is most likely to provide long-term success in this individual?

  MultipleChoice:
    Correct: Modular titanium tibial component and oxidized zirconium femoral component
    Incorrect:
      - All-polyethylene tibial component and pure titanium femoral component
      - All-polyethylene tibial component and cobalt-chromium alloy femoral component
      - Cobalt-chromium alloy tibial component and cobalt-chromium alloy femoral component
      - Modular titanium tibial component and pure titanium femoral component

  CorrectAnswers:
    - titanium tibial tray and zirconium femoral component
  IncorrectAnswers: []

  Keywords: []
  KeywordsOnly: false

  Explanation: >
    Nickel allergy is not an infrequent preoperative finding. The ramifications of such allergies in arthroplasty patients are poorly understood at this time. Stainless steel and cobalt-chromium alloys contain relatively high concentrations of nickel. Titanium, oxidized zirconium, and polyethylene do not contain significant amounts of nickel. Titanium is not a good surface for the articulating portion of the femoral component because of its propensity for metallosis. Oxidized zirconium is the only suitable femoral component for patients allergic to nickel. A modular titanium tibial component or an all-polyethylene tibial component would be satisfactory for these patients.

  Question: >
    Increasing tibial polyethylene conformity can have what effect on fixed bearing total knee arthroplasty?

  MultipleChoice:
    Correct: Decreased femoral rollback during flexion
    Incorrect:
      - Increased contact stress within the polyethylene
      - Increased risk of polyethylene delamination
      - Decreased mechanical forces transferred to the fixation surfaces
      - Increased femoral rotation during flexion

  CorrectAnswers:
    - less risk of polyethylene wear
    - less risk of polyethylene fracture
    - less risk of polyethylene delamination
    - increased shear stress to fixation surfaces of the implants
    - less femoral rollback
  IncorrectAnswers:
    - more femoral rollback
    - increased risk of polyethylene wear

  Keywords: []
  KeywordsOnly: false

  Explanation: >
    Increasing conformity between the tibial polyethylene bearing and the femoral component has desirable and undesirable consequences. Increased conformity increases the contact area and thereby reduces contact stress within the polyethylene. This can lead to less risk of polyethylene wear, fracture, and delamination. However, increasing conformity also limits the ability of the femur to roll back during flexion, and may transfer increased shear stress to the fixation surfaces of the implants.

    Patients with patellar clunk syndrome are best managed by what method?

  MultipleChoice:
    Correct: Surgical debridement
    Incorrect:
      - Rest and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      - Patellectomy
      - Patellar revision
      - Lateral release/patellar realignment

  CorrectAnswers:
    - debridement of the cyclops lesion
    - arthroscopic debridement
    - open debridement
  IncorrectAnswers: []

  Keywords: []
  KeywordsOnly: false

  Explanation: >
    Patellar clunk syndrome is usually the result of a fibrous nodule that forms on the undersurface of the distal quadriceps tendon.  It may get entrapped in the intercondylar notch of the femoral component during flexion, and lead to a sudden snap as the nodule is pulled out of the notch during active extension.  Nonsurgical management is rarely successful.  Surgical debridement is usually curative, with only rare recurrence.  More aggressive procedures such as realignment, revision, or patellectomy are usually not necessary, and are reserved for cases resistant to soft-tissue debridement.

  Question: >
    What should the patient's postoperative physical therapy regimen include?
    During the course of a revision total knee arthroplasty via a medial parapatellar exposure, the surgeon does a complete intra-articular release and synovectomy but exposure is still inadequate. A quadriceps snip is performed and, at the end of the procedure, the knee is stable throughout a range of motion, and the postoperative radiographs show acceptable alignment of the components.
    What should the patient's postoperative physical therapy regimen include?

  MultipleChoice:
    Correct: No restriction in range of motion or weight bearing after surgery.
    Incorrect:
      - Limit flexion to 30 degrees postoperatively, progressing 10 degrees per week
      - Limit flexion to 90 degrees for the first 6 weeks postoperatively
      - Limit to active flexion only with no passive flexion or active extension for 6 weeks
      - Use of a hinged knee brace for 6 weeks postoperatively

  CorrectAnswers:
    - no restriction
    - full weight bearing as tolerated
  IncorrectAnswers:
    - partial weight bearing

  Keywords: []
  KeywordsOnly: false

  Explanation: >
    A quadriceps snip is performed by extending a medial parapatellar approach superiorly and laterally across the quadriceps tendon.  It is then repaired primarily at the end of the procedure.  The primary advantage of this technique over other surgical maneuvers that improve exposure at the time of revision total knee arthroplasty is that the postoperative regimen for physical therapy does not need to be altered.

    What is the definition of the term "paradoxical motion," used to describe knee kinematics?

  MultipleChoice:
    Correct: The tibiofemoral contact point moves anteriorly during knee flexion
    Incorrect:
      - The patella does not roll forward into the trochlear groove during knee extension
      - The tibia rolls back on the femur during knee extension
      - The posterior cruciate ligament rolls posteriorly with respect to the anterior cruciate ligament during knee extension
      - The femur rolls back on the tibia during knee flexion

  CorrectAnswers:
    - the femur rolls forward on the tibia during knee flexion
    - the femur rolls anteriorly on the tibia during knee flexion
  IncorrectAnswers: []

  Keywords: []
  KeywordsOnly: false

  Explanation: >
    The term "rollback" describes the posterior movement of the tibiofemoral contact point with knee motion from extension to flexion. Therefore, with "paradoxical rollback" this contact point moves anteriorly. "Paradoxical rollback" is a term used to connote the inability of the anterior cruciate-deficient, posterior cruciate-retaining total knee prosthesis to create normal posterior femoral rollback with knee flexion.
