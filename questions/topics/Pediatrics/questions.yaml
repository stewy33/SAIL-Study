  Explanation: >
    Proximal humeral fractures in children are most often treated nonsurgically, even with displaced patterns.  Therefore, treatments that include closed or open reduction are not indicated.  There is little controversy in the treatment of proximal humerus fractures in this age group and most patients attain good functional outcomes.  The humerus contributes about 80% of the growth of the humerus and has excellent remodeling potential.  Some reports indicate higher complication rates when surgically treated.

    Multiple biomechanical studies have shown that the addition of a third pin from the lateral side improves construct stiffness in the presence of medial column loss or slight internal rotation of the distal fragment. The same studies show that addition of a medial pin (cross pinning) has essentially the same benefit. Placement of a medial pin increases risk for iatrogenic nerve injury.

  KeywordsOnly: false

  Explanation: >
    The radiographs show a Gartland type III supracondylar humerus fracture.  Although multiple classification systems exist that describe supracondylar humerus fractures, Gartland's classification is simple and widely used.  Type I fractures are nondisplaced according to this classification.  Type II fractures are displaced with a variable amount of angulation, but the posterior cortex of the humerus is intact.  Type III fractures are completely displaced with no cortical contact.  In flexion-type supracondylar humerus fractures, the distal fragments are anterior to the humeral shaft.  The most appropriate treatment method for this fracture is attempted closed reduction and pin fixation.  Closed reduction and casting is inappropriate for a Gartland type III supracondylar humerus fracture.  Although open reduction may be required in some cases, most supracondylar humerus fractures, even those that are severely displaced, can be treated with closed reduction and percutaneous pin fixation (and this should be the initial approach).  Although olecranon traction is an option in managing these fractures, it involves repeated radiographs and prolonged hospitalization and is not widely used in North America.  The preoperative examination is consistent with a radial nerve injury.  Neuropraxias are common in supracondylar humerus fractures, with anterior interosseous nerve injury being the most common, followed by radial nerve.  Ulnar nerve injuries occur in flexion-type supracondylar fractures and occasionally as the result of medial pin placement during surgery. The recurrent motor branch of the median nerve supplies the thenar muscles.

  Explanation: >
    The radiographs show a distal radial shaft fracture.  The distal radial physis appears to be nearly or completely closed, so significant remodeling of the residual bayonette apposition should not be expected.  The patient has already attempted manipulation, whether in an office setting or under general anesthesia, so they are unlikely to maintain an adequate reduction.  In this age group, treatment of radial shaft fractures with internal fixation provides the most definitive outcome, posing the least risk for repeat surgery, and allows early rehabilitation.

  Explanation: >
    Straightforward trajectory when placing pedicle screws in addition to prior tapping 1mm smaller than the screw diameter increase the maximal insertional torque and resistance to screw pullout.
    Contemporary segmental pedicle screw placement used in the treatment of scoliosis deformity offer significantly higher screw pullout and deformity correction than prior hook and wire constructs. Additionally, screw insertional torque has been found in numerous studies to correlate with resistance to screw pullout. Several factors have been found to increase maximum screw insertional torque, including tapping 1mm smaller than the screw diameter and using the straightforward trajectory. It is important to note that while undertapping makes for a stronger screw, there are some studies that suggest not tapping at all makes for an even stronger screw.
    Lehman et al. performed a biomechanical study evaluating maximum insertional torque when tapping line to line, undertapping by 0.5mm, and undertapping by 1mm in 34 fresh frozen cadavers. They found undertapping the thoracic pedicle by 1mm increased maximum insertional torque by 47% when compared to undertapping by 0.5mm and by 93% when compared to line to line tapping.
    Kuklo et al. performed a biomechanical study on thirty cadavers using the straightforward technique (sagittal trajectory of the screws parallels the superior endplate of the vertebral body) versus anatomic trajectory (22 degrees in the cephalo-caudad direction in the sagittal plane). They found maximum insertional torque to be 2.58 pounds using the straightforward technique versus 1.86 pounds using the anatomic trajectory (p=0.0005).

  Explanation: >
    Infantile idiopathic scoliosis occurs more commonly in boys, with a 3 to 1 male to female ratio. Neural axis abnormalities, hip dysplasia, and congenital heart disease are all associated with the condition; spontaneous correction frequently occurs. Curve progression can be predicted by the rib vertebral angle difference or the phase of the rib head. Rib overlap of the apical vertebral body or a rib vertebral angle difference of greater than 20 degrees indicates that the curve is likely to progress. Gender, family history, and age at presentation have not been found to be risk factors for progression.

    Triplane fractures generally occur in children who are near skeletal maturity.  The injury is generally caused by a supination external rotation mechanism.  The number of fracture fragments present (two or three) depends on what part of the physes is closed at the time of injury.  Articular congruity is the major concern in the management of these injuries since the patient has almost reached skeletal maturity.  The goal is to restore articular congruity to minimize the development of posttraumatic arthritis.

    Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) affects 1 in 5,000 children and historically (prior to antibiotics) nearly half died due to the disease. Fortunately, the mortality rate is much lower today (less than 1%), but prompt diagnosis and treatment is critical to decrease the morbidity of this disease. Often many of the laboratory values may not be elevated, and cultures may not be positive; in fact, the WBC count and cultures (even bone) are positive less than half the time. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is positive over 90% of the time, and often highly elevated but does not peak for 3 to 5 days. The C-reactive protein is elevated in 98% of patients with AHO, and decreases quickly after appropriate antibiotic therapy. The differential diagnosis of AHO is long, and includes bony tumors and leukemia, which should be considered, especially if the child fails to respond to appropriate treatment.

    Sprengel's deformity or congenital elevation of the scapula is the result of failure of caudal migration of the scapula.  Approximately 30% of patients with this condition have an omovertebral bone as seen in the figures.  In this patient the deformity is bilateral.  Bilateral deformities occur in 10% to 30% of these cases.  Cartilage, fibrous tissue or bone (the omovertebral bone) may attach the scapula to the cervical and thoracic spine.  The latter limits shoulder abduction to 90 degrees.  Cosmetically, the neck is broad and webbed similar to the condition seen in Turner syndrome.  Sprengel's deformity is found in 35% of patients with Klippel-Feil syndrome.  Facial scapular humeral dystrophy does not entail an omoverterbral bone as noted on this patient's CT scan.

    The child has infantile tibia vara, also called Blount's disease. The radiograph shows sloping of the medial metaphysis and irregularity of the epiphysis. The most appropriate treatment in a child who is younger than age 4 years, with progressive varus, and who has the radiographic findings described above is tibia and fibula osteotomy. Although the natural history of Blount's disease is not known with certainty, some studies predict that patients who have more advanced radiographic changes will develop progressive genu varum. Observation may be useful in young infants when the differentiation between infantile tibia vara and physiologic genu varum is uncertain. Although controversial, bracing may have a role in early, mild Blount's disease. Epiphysiodesis is not indicated in a 3+-year-old child. Hemi-plateau elevation may be considered in children with severe uncorrected or relapsed infantile tibia vara.

    The radiographs show a severe pseudarthrosis tibia/fibula that has fractured. This is highly associated with neurofibromatosis type I, which needs to be evaluated with a genetics workup before discussing treatment. Cast immobilization is not needed if the child is not walking and not in pain. Surgical management should proceed only after the workup is complete. This is a congenital condition, not a fracture, so workup for abuse is not indicated.

  MultipleChoice:
    Correct: Patellar tendon bearing (PTB) orthosis
    Incorrect:
      - Observation
      - Osteotomy to correct the deformity and fixation with an intramedullary rod
      - Vascularized fibular graft from the contralateral leg
      - Amputation

  CorrectAnswers:
    - brace treatment
    - orthotics

  Explanation: >
    The patient has a prefractured stage of congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia and is at risk for fracture. The PTB orthosis may prevent or delay the fracture. Osteotomy is frequently complicated by nonunion. When established nonunion does not respond to intramedullary nailing and bone grafting, vascularized grafting may succeed. Amputation is a salvage procedure.

  Question: >
    What outcome should the parents be advised to expect?
    A toddler is brought in by his parents for evaluation of gait problems.  Birth history and neurologic examination are unremarkable.  After evaluating femoral torsion, tibial torsion, and foot contour, the diagnosis is excessive internal tibial torsion.  
    What outcome should the parents be advised to expect?

  MultipleChoice:
    Correct: Resolution by age 3 or 4 years without active treatment in most patients
    Incorrect:
      - Resolution by age 8 or 9 years without active treatment in most patients
      - Resolution with casting as the most effective treatment
      - Resolution with bracing and shoe modification as the most effective treatment
      - Resolution with surgery as the most effective treatment

  Explanation: >
    Excessive internal tibial torsion is a common cause of intoeing in toddlers. In most children, this resolves spontaneously by 3 to 4 years of age. Intoeing in elementary age children is usually the result of excessive femoral anteversion. Studies have shown that active intervention (casting, splinting, and shoe modifications) has no demonstrable effect on the natural history or resolution of tibial torsion. Surgery is rarely indicated in adolescents with severe internal tibial torsion that has not resolved and is resulting in cosmetic and functional problems.

  Explanation: >
    These triplets exhibit genu varum and internal tibial torsion that can be part of normal development. Fetal packing is the likely major contributing cause for these triplets, however. Observation and follow-up will be sufficient. Bowing and torsion can be clinical features of vitamin D deficiency, Blount disease, and short-stature syndromes, but these are not the most likely diagnoses. Radiographic diagnosis of Blount disease may not be accurate at this age.

    What is the etiology of the size difference between the left and right?
    The figure is the photograph of a 10-year-old girl standing without shoes who underwent surgical correction of a left clubfoot deformity at age one. The family is concerned that her left lower extremity is smaller than the right. 
    What is the etiology of the size difference between the left and right?

  Explanation: >
    Smallness of the entire lower extremity is intrinsic to clubfoot deformity. Multiple etiologies for size difference have been investigated to include vascular, neurologic, and difference in tissue type. Arterial abnormalities in clubfeet appear to produce a deletion phenomenon. Arteriography has shown that a larger percentage of clubfeet have abnormal arterial patterns, with the posterior tibial artery being the predominant vascular supply. Studies suggest that the absence of peripheral nerves or denervation decreases the rate of bone maturation, and this effect may be responsible for the diminished size of denervated limbs and may explain this phenomenon in clubfoot. However, bone age has been found to be similar in those with clubfoot and controls. Tethering of the cord has not been found to be associated with idiopathic clubfoot. The majority of clubfeet have relatively normal muscle fibers. Hemihypertrophy of the contralateral limb is not associated with clubfoot deformity.

  Question: >
    An 18-month-old infant with myelomeningocele and rigid clubfeet has grade 5 quadriceps and hamstring strength, but no muscles are functioning below the knee. 
    What is the best treatment option for the rigid clubfeet?

  MultipleChoice:
    Correct: Soft-tissue releases as necessary
    Incorrect:
      - Triple arthrodesis
      - Tendon transfers to balance the feet in a neutral plantigrade position
      - Physical therapy for range of motion and stretching
      - Botulinum injections followed by serial casting

  CorrectAnswers:
    - soft tissue releases as needed
  IncorrectAnswers: []

  Keywords: []
  KeywordsOnly: false   
   
  Explanation: >
    This child has the potential to walk and therefore should have all the contracted structures in the feet released as necessary to place the feet in a plantigrade position for fitting of ankle-foot orthoses. Physical therapy, manipulation, and casting may provide some benefit in a newborn with flexible feet but are not effective in an older infant with rigid clubfeet. Botulinum injections and tendon transfers are of no use because there are no muscles functioning below the knee. Tendon releases are more effective than tendon transfers in children with myelomeningocele.

    Incorrect:
      - Posterior tibialis and peroneus brevis
      - Anterior tibialis and peroneus longus

  IncorrectAnswers: []

  Keywords: [[posterior],[tibialis],[peroneal],[longus]]
  KeywordsOnly: false   
      
  Explanation: >
    In Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, the posterior tibialis and peroneus longus tendons remain strong, serving to invert the hindfoot and depress the first metatarsal head thus causing the cavovarus foot associated with this disease. In contrast, the tibialis anterior and peroneus brevis are less functional and therefore cannot dorsiflex the ankle, elevate the first metatarsal, or evert the foot, contributing to the deformity.

  Explanation: >
    Friedrich ataxia is a spinocerebellar disorder characterized by ataxic gait, areflexia, muscle weakness, loss of propioception, scoliosis, and foot deformity. Foot deformity can consist of varus heel, cavus deformity, and claw toes. Hip dysplasia can be associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a hereditary motor sensory neuropathy. Patients with Blount disease often have progressive tibia vara and associated femoral deformity. Malignant hyperthermia has been reported in patients with myelomeningocele.

  Explanation: >
      Deletions in the SMN-I gene are found in 95% to 98% of patients with spinal muscular atrophy. Genetic testing is typically part of the diagnostic workup for spinal muscular atrophy. A positive test result is diagnostic, and, in most cases, eliminates the need for muscle biopsy. The other choices are not associated with spinal muscular atrophy. Defects in PMP22 are the cause of 70% to 80% of cases of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Mutations in the dystrophin gene cause Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and mutations in the androgen receptor cause spinobulbar muscular atrophy (Kennedy's disease).

    What study is necessary prior to any shoulder reconstruction?
    An 18-month-old boy with obstetric brachial plexus palsy is being evaluated for limited right shoulder motion.  Physical therapy for the past 6 months has failed to result in improvement of the contracture. 
    What study is necessary prior to any shoulder reconstruction?

  MultipleChoice:
    Correct: MRI of the shoulder joint
    Incorrect:
      - Electromyography
      - MRI of the brain
      - Radiograph of the elbow
      - Aspiration of the right shoulder

  Keywords: []
  KeywordsOnly: false   
      
  Explanation: >
    The child sustained a brachial plexus injury at birth, and internal rotation/adduction contractures frequently develop at the shoulder. Initial treatment should consist of physical therapy to increase the range of motion. If this fails, as in this patient, MRI is used to evaluate the glenohumeral joint. Commonly, there is joint deformity with increased retroversion of the glenoid and even posterior shoulder subluxation. If the deformity is mild, an anterior release, coupled with teres major and latissimus transfers, is very effective. If the deformity is severe and the shoulder is unreconstructable, then humeral derotation osteotomy is the procedure of choice. MRI of the brain, a radiograph of the elbow, and aspiration of the shoulder would not be helpful.
